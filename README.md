# Path Optimization using AI for Logistics

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing delivery routes using AI-driven techniques to enhance logistics efficiency. The model leverages machine learning and optimization algorithms to determine the most efficient paths, minimizing cost and delivery time.

## Features
- Route optimization based on AI algorithms
- Cost and time-efficient path selection
- Scalable for various logistics networks
- Real-time adaptability to traffic and demand changes

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Optimization Libraries (e.g., NetworkX, OR-Tools)
- Data Processing with Pandas and NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
